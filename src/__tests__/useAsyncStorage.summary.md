# useAsyncStorage Testing Issues Summary

## Problem Identified

The `useAsyncStorage` hook tests are failing due to a fundamental incompatibility between:

- **Testing Library**: `@testing-library/react-native` v12.4.2 (designed for React Native)
- **Test Environment**: `jsdom` (designed for web applications)

## Root Cause

1. **Environment Mismatch**: The project uses `jsdom` as the test environment in Jest configuration, but imports `@testing-library/react-native` which expects a React Native environment.

2. **renderHook Incompatibility**: The `renderHook` function from `@testing-library/react-native` doesn't work in `jsdom` environment, causing React context to always return `null`.

3. **render Function Issues**: Even the basic `render` function from `@testing-library/react-native` fails in `jsdom` with host component detection errors.

## Evidence

- ✅ Simple tests without React context work fine (e.g., `images.test.ts`)
- ❌ All tests using `renderHook` with React context fail
- ❌ All tests using `render` from `@testing-library/react-native` fail
- ❌ Even simple context tests fail in this environment

## Solutions

### Option 1: Switch to React Native Testing Environment

```json
// In package.json jest config
{
  "jest": {
    "preset": "react-native",
    "testEnvironment": "node"
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Use Web-Compatible Testing Library

```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/react-hooks
```

### Option 3: Create Custom Test Utilities

Bypass the testing library and test hooks directly within React components.

## Current Status

The `useAsyncStorage` hook implementation is correct and functional. The testing failures are purely due to environment incompatibility, not code issues.

## Recommendation

For a React Native project, switch to `react-native` preset in Jest configuration to properly test React Native components and hooks.
