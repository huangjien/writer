   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Current coverage is critically low at 15.88%

3. **Priority 3: Branch Coverage**
   - Add tests for conditional logic paths
   - Test error handling branches
   - Target 80%+ branch coverage

4. **Priority 4: Function Coverage**
   - Ensure all exported functions are tested
   - Add tests for utility functions
   - Current function coverage is 33.33%

### 📊 Coverage Targets

| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|----- |
| Statements | 40.78% | 80% | +39.22% |
| Branches | 28.9% | 80% | +51.1% |
| Functions | 33.33% | 80% | +46.67% |
| Lines | 39.94% | 80% | +40.06% |

### 📈 Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:

   - Test custom hooks (useReading.ts, useAsyncStorage.tsx)
   - Add error handling tests

2. **Medium-term Goals**:
   - Achieve 60%+ overall coverage
   - Improve branch coverage to 50%+
   - Add integration tests

3. **Long-term Goals**:
   - Achieve 80%+ coverage across all metrics
   - Implement automated coverage reporting
   - Set up coverage gates in CI/CD
