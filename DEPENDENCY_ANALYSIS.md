# Dependency Analysis Report

## Status: RESOLVED - Development Server Fixed ‚úÖ

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-03
**Priority:** P1 (Test infrastructure improvements needed)

## ‚úÖ Resolution Results

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Critical Expo SDK Conflicts:** Resolved by updating `@expo/cli` to latest version
2. **Missing Dependencies:** Added `@react-native-community/cli-server-api`
3. **Multiple Lock Files:** Removed `yarn.lock`, using npm exclusively
4. **Development Server:** Now starts successfully at `http://localhost:8081`

### Current Status:
- **Doctor Checks:** 14/15 passed (only React Native Directory warnings remain)
- **Development Server:** ‚úÖ Working
- **Test Suite:** 124 failed, 366 passed (same as before - infrastructure issues persist)
- **Build Stability:** ‚úÖ Improved

### Next Steps:
1. Address test infrastructure issues (AsyncStorageProvider, context initialization)
2. Fix Jest configuration and mock setup
3. Improve test coverage as outlined in TEST_FIXES_ACTION_PLAN.md

## Overview
This document analyzes the dependency conflicts identified by `./doctor.sh` and provides actionable solutions to resolve them.

## üî¥ Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Expo SDK Package Version Conflicts

The project has **multiple versions** of critical Expo packages installed simultaneously, causing conflicts:

#### @expo/config-plugins
- **Expected**: ~10.1.1
- **Found**: 8.0.11 (from @expo/cli@0.18.31)
- **Also Present**: 10.1.1 (from expo-splash-screen@0.30.9)

#### @expo/prebuild-config
- **Expected**: ~9.0.0
- **Found**: 7.0.9 (from @expo/cli@0.18.31)
- **Also Present**: 9.0.9 (from expo-splash-screen@0.30.9)

#### @expo/metro-config
- **Expected**: ~0.20.0
- **Found**: 0.18.11 (from @expo/cli@0.18.31)
- **Root Cause**: Outdated @expo/cli version

### 2. React Native Directory Validation Issues

The following packages lack metadata in React Native Directory:
- `@octokit/rest` - GitHub API client
- `@octokit/types` - GitHub API types
- `ahooks` - React hooks library
- `husky` - Git hooks tool
- `nanoid` - ID generator

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Outdated @expo/cli
The main culprit is **@expo/cli@0.18.31** which pulls in older versions of Expo packages that conflict with the newer versions required by Expo SDK 53.

### Secondary Issue: Package Resolution
The project uses `resolutions` in package.json but doesn't include the problematic Expo packages.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Strategy

### Phase 1: Update Core Dependencies (Critical)

1. **Update @expo/cli to latest version**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @expo/cli@latest
   ```

2. **Clear node_modules and package-lock.json**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

3. **Verify the fix**:
   ```bash
   ./doctor.sh
   ```

### Phase 2: Add Package Resolutions (Preventive)

Add to package.json resolutions:
```json
"resolutions": {
  "@expo/cli": "^0.18.30",
  "@expo/config-plugins": "~10.1.1",
  "@expo/prebuild-config": "~9.0.0",
  "@expo/metro-config": "~0.20.0",
  "wrap-ansi": "7.0.0",
  "string-width": "4.1.0"
}
```

### Phase 3: Address React Native Directory Issues (Optional)

The following packages lack metadata in React Native Directory but are safe to use:
- `@octokit/rest`, `@octokit/types` - Official GitHub API packages
- `ahooks` - Popular React hooks library
- `husky` - Git hooks tool (development dependency)
- `nanoid` - Secure ID generator

To suppress these warnings, add to package.json:
```json
"expo": {
  "doctor": {
    "reactNativeDirectoryCheck": {
      "listUnknownPackages": false
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can ignore this warning as these packages are legitimate and widely used.

## üìä Impact Assessment

### On Test Coverage
- **Current**: 124 failing tests
- **Expected Improvement**: 15-25% reduction in test failures
- **Reason**: Dependency conflicts can cause module resolution issues

### On Build Stability
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Impact**: Build failures, runtime errors, tooling issues
- **Priority**: Immediate fix required

### On Development Experience
- **IDE Issues**: IntelliSense problems, import resolution
- **Tooling**: Metro bundler conflicts, CLI command failures
- **Hot Reload**: Potential instability

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

1. **Run doctor check**:
   ```bash
   ./doctor.sh
   ```
   Expected: 15/15 checks passed

2. **Test build process**:
   ```bash
   npm run android
   npm run ios
   ```

3. **Run test suite**:
   ```bash
   npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false
   ```
   Expected: Reduction in failing tests

4. **Check dependency tree**:
   ```bash
   npm ls @expo/config-plugins
   npm ls @expo/prebuild-config
   npm ls @expo/metro-config
   ```

## üéØ Success Metrics
